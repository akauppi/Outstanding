# Outstanding 

<!-- tbd. add "ry." if we get it registered -->

Outstanding ry. is an association for progressing the technologies needed for implementing Ultra Light Rail networks.

This repo is for planning the association's functioning. A portal, though those haven't been trending since 2000's.

## Association 

- [Perustamiskirja](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HZK-vHX7lue9t2XMDMoy5IAMjBM7OsrBlS45WWubT8Y) (Google Docs; in Finnish)
  - this is the official terms of association document

### To-do

- [ ]¬†Get association registered ("outstanding ry.")
- [ ]¬†open GitHub presence
  - [ ]¬†move this and two asset repos to the association 
- [ ]¬†open Google presence
  - for Docs, Sheets, Meet, Firebase, ...
  - [ ]¬†move [Kotka PBS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G5YIdf7PlUv7BphEBALlFeB5Ye0DMoW4dylRe6NaBZk) (Google Sheets) to the association

<!--
Domain would be needed once we have a web app to host.

Lurk on outstanding-org that expires x-Nov-20

## Rail Simulator

Rail Simulator (or just Track?) is a multi-user, graphical web application. It has a map layer beneath and allows editing a track in one's neighbourhood (or well, anywhere in the world).

The work on [GroundLevel ‚ô†Ô∏è ES6 ‚ô†Ô∏è Firebase](https://github.com/akauppi/GroundLevel-es6-firebase-web) is aiming to make an open source platform that such a dedicated application is built upon.

The aim:

Opening our technology choices. Helping others develop web apps with the same stack and approach. This brings talent and interest to our larger project. Also - we might get framework level advice and improvements, so the Sim app can focus on domain specific work.

We might not open source Sim, at least not initially.

GroundLevel is MIT licensed.


## CAD Prototypes

[Kotka](https://akauppi.github.io/Kotka/) is a recipe for making ultra-light rail devices.

The aim is to provide a platform that shows this kind of transportation is possible. It's both a discussion starter, technology exploration platform but also something companies can license to build their commercial offerings on. 

We're not going to Mars. We're staying 3-5m above the ground, and aiming to not get noticed.

Resources:

- [Kotka PBS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G5YIdf7PlUv7BphEBALlFeB5Ye0DMoW4dylRe6NaBZk/) (Google Sheets)
  - Product Breakdown System: defines the modularity and maturity of the parts
- CAD models (private for now)

Collaborative work on the CAD models is the beef of this area. However, access is currently closed, until we find the right patterns with the initial contributors.


### To-do

- [ ]¬†create a contributor contract (handle claims, patents etc.) that people can sign (electronically???)
